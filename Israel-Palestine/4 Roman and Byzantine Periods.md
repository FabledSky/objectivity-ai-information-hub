## Roman and Byzantine Periods
#### Roman Destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE)

In 70 CE, during the First Jewish Revolt (66-73 CE), Roman forces led by General Titus besieged Jerusalem, resulting in the destruction of the Second Temple. This marked a catastrophic turning point for Jewish religious and cultural life. The Temple, central to Jewish worship, was demolished, leaving only the Western Wall, which remains a sacred site today. The destruction led to widespread Jewish displacement and the beginnings of the Jewish Diaspora. Roman historian Josephus provides a detailed account of the siege, describing the widespread devastation, enslavement of survivors, and executions. Archaeological evidence, including remnants of the Second Temple and layers of destruction in Jerusalem, corroborates these accounts. 

#### Aftermath of the Jewish Revolt (70-130 CE)

Following the revolt, Roman authorities imposed harsh penalties on the Jewish population. The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax levied on Jews throughout the empire, funded the Temple of Jupiter in Rome. Many Jewish communities reorganized in diaspora locations such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Babylonia, fostering a growing emphasis on synagogue worship and religious study. This period laid the groundwork for post-Temple Judaism. 

#### Bar Kokhba Revolt and Renaming of Jerusalem (132-136 CE)

The Bar Kokhba Revolt (132-136 CE), led by Simon Bar Kokhba, was a Jewish rebellion against Roman rule, driven by resistance to Emperor Hadrian's policies, including the construction of a Roman temple on the Temple Mount. Initially successful, the revolt established an independent Jewish state for a brief period. However, Roman forces crushed the rebellion in 136 CE, killing hundreds of thousands of Jews and further depopulating the region. Jerusalem was renamed Aelia Capitolina, and a Roman colony was built on its ruins. Jews were banned from entering the city, intensifying the Jewish Diaspora. 

#### Romanization of the Region (2nd-3rd Centuries CE)

During the 2nd and 3rd centuries, Jerusalem and surrounding areas became fully integrated into the Roman Empire. Pagan temples and Roman administrative structures dominated the landscape. Roman engineering achievements, such as roads and aqueducts, transformed the region's infrastructure. The population consisted of a mix of pagans, Jews, and early Christians, with periodic tensions among these groups. 

#### Spread of Christianity and Constantine's Reign (313 CE)

In 313 CE, Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, legalizing Christianity and ending centuries of Christian persecution. Constantine's reign marked a pivotal moment as Christianity transitioned from a minority faith to the dominant religion of the empire. Jerusalem became a central site for Christian pilgrimage, revered as the location of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection. The city's religious significance was further elevated when Constantine's mother, Helena, identified key Christian sites, including Golgotha and the tomb of Christ. 

#### Construction of Christian Holy Sites (4th Century CE)

In 335 CE, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was completed, marking the site traditionally associated with Jesus's burial and resurrection. Other major constructions included the Basilica of the Nativity in Bethlehem and churches on the Mount of Olives. These projects solidified Jerusalem's role as a Christian religious center. Archaeological evidence, including fragments of these structures, supports their historical significance. 

#### Byzantine Rule and Religious Transformation (4th-6th Centuries CE)

Under Byzantine rule, which followed the division of the Roman Empire in 395 CE, Jerusalem became a key city in a predominantly Christian state. Pagan temples were dismantled or repurposed as churches. Jewish access to Jerusalem remained restricted, although Jewish communities persisted in Galilee and other areas. Christian monasticism flourished, particularly in the Judean Desert, where monasteries like Mar Saba were established. This period also saw tensions between different Christian sects, particularly over Christological doctrines. 

#### Persian Invasion and Fall of Jerusalem (614 CE)

In 614 CE, the Sasanian (Persian) Empire invaded Byzantine territories, capturing Jerusalem. The Persian army, supported by some local Jewish populations, desecrated Christian holy sites, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. For a brief period, Jewish leaders administered Jerusalem under Persian oversight. However, the Persian control was short-lived. 

#### Byzantine Reconquest (628 CE)

Emperor Heraclius recaptured Jerusalem in 628 CE, restoring Byzantine control. The Byzantines rebuilt Christian sites and reinstated strict policies against Jews, including expulsions and massacres. This period marked the final phase of Byzantine dominance over Jerusalem before the advent of Islam.

#### Prelude to Islamic Conquest (630s CE)

By the early 7th century, the Byzantine Empire was weakened by continuous wars with the Sasanian Empire and internal religious divisions. This instability set the stage for the Islamic conquest of Jerusalem and the surrounding region, which occurred in the 630s under the Rashidun Caliphate.
