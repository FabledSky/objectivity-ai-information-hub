## Interwar Period and the Road to 1948
### World War I and the Balfour Declaration (1917)

#### Hussein-McMahon Correspondence (1915-1916)

The Hussein-McMahon Correspondence involved a series of letters between Sharif Hussein of Mecca and British High Commissioner Sir Henry McMahon. Britain promised Arab independence in exchange for support against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Although Palestine was not explicitly mentioned in the letters, subsequent British actions, such as the Balfour Declaration, created tensions with Arab leaders who believed Palestine would be included in their independence.

#### Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916)

The Sykes-Picot Agreement was a secret pact between Britain and France that divided the Ottoman territories in the Middle East into spheres of influence. Palestine was designated for international administration. The revelation of this agreement by the Bolsheviks in 1917 fueled Arab mistrust of British intentions.

#### Balfour Declaration (1917)

In November 1917, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour issued a declaration supporting "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," provided it did not prejudice the rights of non-Jewish communities. The declaration was vague and controversial, leading to conflicting interpretations by Jews and Arabs.

#### British Capture of Jerusalem (1917)

British forces, led by General Edmund Allenby, entered Jerusalem in December 1917, ending Ottoman rule over the city after four centuries. Allenby declared respect for all religious communities, marking the beginning of British administrative control over Palestine.

### The British Mandate for Palestine (1920-1948)

#### San Remo Conference and Mandate Establishment (1920)

The San Remo Conference formalized Britain's control over Palestine. The League of Nations subsequently approved the British Mandate, which incorporated the Balfour Declaration. This gave Britain administrative authority and the responsibility to implement the declaration while safeguarding the rights of the local Arab population.

#### Early Tensions and Riots (1920-1921)

-   1920 Nebi Musa Riots: These riots, sparked by religious celebrations, escalated into violence between Arabs and Jews in Jerusalem, leaving five Jews and four Arabs dead.
-   1921 Jaffa Riots: Tensions over increasing Jewish immigration led to violent clashes in Jaffa, resulting in over 100 deaths. The riots underscored growing Arab resentment toward British policies and Zionist land acquisitions.

#### White Paper of 1922

In response to unrest, Britain issued the Churchill White Paper, clarifying that a Jewish national home would not encompass all of Palestine and reiterating the political rights of the Arab population. However, this did little to quell tensions.

### Jewish Immigration and Land Purchases (1920s-1930s)

#### Zionist Immigration (Aliyahs)

-   First Aliyah (1882-1903) and Second Aliyah (1904-1914): Predating the mandate, these waves brought primarily Eastern European Jews fleeing persecution.
-   Third Aliyah (1919-1923): Following World War I and the Russian Revolution, Jewish immigration resumed, with settlers focusing on agriculture and building communal farms (kibbutzim).
-   Fourth Aliyah (1924-1928): Economic instability in Europe, particularly in Poland, spurred another wave of immigration.
-   Fifth Aliyah (1933-1939): The rise of Nazism in Germany brought tens of thousands of Jews to Palestine, further straining relations with the Arab population.

#### Land Purchases and Displacement

Zionist organizations facilitated land purchases, often from absentee landlords. Palestinian tenant farmers were frequently displaced, leading to widespread resentment and contributing to economic instability for Arab communities.

### Arab Nationalism and Resistance

#### Western Wall Riots (1929)

Disputes over access to the Western Wall escalated into violence in Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine. Over 200 people were killed, with the violence highlighting the intensifying struggle for control over religious and cultural sites.

#### Formation of Arab Nationalist Movements

Arab nationalist leaders, including Haj Amin al-Husseini, organized political and grassroots resistance to British policies and Zionist immigration. The Arab Executive, established in the 1920s, sought to coordinate efforts for Palestinian independence.

### The Arab Revolt and British Policies (1936-1939)

#### Arab Revolt

The Arab Revolt unfolded in three distinct phases:

1.  General Strike (1936): A six-month strike targeted British policies and Jewish immigration.
2.  Rural Uprisings (1937-1938): Armed resistance spread across rural areas, targeting British infrastructure and Jewish settlements.
3.  Suppression (1939): British forces, with assistance from Jewish militias, suppressed the revolt, killing thousands of Palestinians and severely weakening Arab leadership.

#### Peel Commission Report (1937)

The Peel Commission proposed partitioning Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The plan was accepted by Zionist leaders as a basis for negotiation but rejected outright by Arab leaders, who opposed partition on principle.

#### White Paper of 1939

To address Arab grievances, Britain issued the White Paper, restricting Jewish immigration and land purchases. Zionist leaders viewed this as a betrayal, particularly as Jewish refugees from Europe sought refuge from Nazi persecution.

### World War II and the Holocaust (1939-1945)

#### Impact of the Holocaust

The Holocaust, during which six million Jews were systematically murdered, intensified international support for a Jewish homeland. Survivors sought refuge in Palestine, but British restrictions on immigration fueled Zionist resistance.

#### Jewish Underground Movements

Jewish underground organizations, such as the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi, launched attacks on British military installations and facilitated illegal immigration (Aliyah Bet), bringing Holocaust survivors to Palestine despite British efforts to block their arrival.

### UNSCOP and Resolution 181: Partition Plan (1947)

#### Formation of UNSCOP

In February 1947, Britain, overwhelmed by escalating violence and unable to reconcile Arab and Jewish demands, referred the Palestine issue to the United Nations. The UN established the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), composed of representatives from 11 countries, tasked with studying the situation and proposing a solution.

-   UNSCOP conducted extensive investigations, including visits to displaced persons' camps in Europe, where Holocaust survivors expressed their desire to immigrate to Palestine.
-   Public hearings in Palestine revealed deep divisions: Jewish representatives largely supported partition, while Arab leaders rejected any plan that would create a Jewish state.

#### The UNSCOP Report

On August 31, 1947, UNSCOP presented two proposals:

1.  Partition Plan: A majority of committee members recommended the division of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international city (corpus separatum) under UN administration.
2.  Federal State Plan: A minority of members proposed a federated state with autonomous Jewish and Arab regions.

The majority partition plan was favored by most Jewish leaders but categorically rejected by Arab representatives, who viewed it as a violation of their national and territorial rights.

#### Adoption of Resolution 181

-   On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, endorsing the partition plan.
    -   Allocation of Land: The plan allocated 56% of Palestine to the Jewish state and 43% to the Arab state, with 1% designated for Jerusalem.
    -   Demographics and Land Ownership: At the time, Jews comprised approximately one-third of the population but owned only about 7% of the land. This imbalance fueled Arab opposition to the plan.
-   The resolution passed with 33 votes in favor, 13 against, and 10 abstentions. Jewish leaders, led by David Ben-Gurion, accepted the plan, while Arab leaders rejected it outright.

#### Reactions to the Partition Plan

-   Jewish Response: Jewish communities celebrated the UN vote, viewing it as a significant step toward statehood. Preparations for state formation, including the mobilization of Jewish militias, accelerated.
-   Arab Response: Arab leaders and neighboring Arab states denounced the plan, declaring it illegitimate. They vowed to resist its implementation by force if necessary.

### Civil War in Palestine (1947-1948)

#### Escalation of Violence

Following the adoption of Resolution 181, violence erupted between Jewish and Arab communities, marking the start of the civil war phase of the conflict. The period was characterized by:

-   Clashes in Mixed Cities: Cities like Jerusalem, Haifa, and Jaffa saw intense street battles, with neighborhoods often becoming segregated as communities fled violence.
-   Disruption of Transportation: Arab militias targeted Jewish convoys and transportation routes, attempting to isolate Jewish communities and disrupt supply lines.

#### Jewish Militias and Plan Dalet

-   The Haganah: The primary Jewish paramilitary organization, initially defensive, began taking more offensive actions as the conflict escalated.
-   Irgun and Lehi: These smaller, more radical groups carried out controversial operations, including bombings and attacks on Arab civilians.
-   Plan Dalet (April 1948): The Haganah implemented Plan Dalet, a strategy to secure Jewish-controlled territories and establish defensible borders for the impending state. While the plan was framed as defensive, its implementation led to the depopulation of numerous Arab villages, intensifying accusations of ethnic cleansing.

#### Arab Forces and Leadership Challenges

-   Arab forces consisted of irregular militias and volunteers from neighboring countries, often poorly organized and lacking centralized leadership.
-   Infighting among Arab factions further weakened their ability to coordinate a unified resistance to Jewish advances.

#### Key Incidents of the Civil War

-   Deir Yassin Massacre (April 9, 1948): Irgun and Lehi fighters attacked the Arab village of Deir Yassin, killing over 100 villagers, including women and children. The incident was widely publicized and contributed to a mass exodus of Palestinians fearing similar attacks.
-   The Battle for Haifa (April 1948): Jewish forces captured the city of Haifa, leading to the flight of tens of thousands of Arab residents.
-   Jaffa and Jerusalem: Heavy fighting in these strategically significant cities resulted in high casualties and large-scale displacements.

#### The Palestinian Exodus (1947-1948)

By mid-1948, an estimated 700,000 Palestinians had fled or been expelled from their homes, an event known as the Nakba (*catastrophe*). Factors contributing to the exodus included:

-   -   Fear of violence following incidents like Deir Yassin.
    -   Direct expulsions carried out by Jewish forces in contested areas.
    -   Collateral effects of the ongoing conflict, including destruction of villages and infrastructure.

### British Withdrawal and the Declaration of Israel (1948)

#### British Withdrawal

-   As violence escalated, Britain announced its intention to terminate the Mandate on May 14, 1948. The British military largely withdrew from the region, avoiding direct involvement in the escalating conflict.
-   The lack of a clear transitional authority created a power vacuum, further exacerbating the violence.

#### Declaration of the State of Israel

-   On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of the State of Israel in Tel Aviv. The declaration referenced the UN partition plan and emphasized Israel's readiness to cooperate with the Arab population and neighboring states.

#### Arab Invasion and the Transition to Regional War

-   The day after Israel's declaration, armies from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon invaded, marking the start of the First Arab-Israeli War.
-   This regional conflict would reshape the political and demographic landscape of Palestine, solidifying the displacement of Palestinian communities and setting the stage for decades of ongoing conflict.
