## 2006–2007: Hamas' Electoral Victory and Political Division
This section delves into the events surrounding Hamas' electoral victory in 2006, the subsequent political and territorial division of the Palestinian territories, and the broader ramifications for the Israel-Palestine conflict.

### Hamas Wins Palestinian Legislative Elections (January 2006)

#### Election Results and Significance

In January 2006, Hamas secured a sweeping victory in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections, winning 74 of the 132 seats and defeating the Fatah party, which won only 45 seats. This marked a significant shift in Palestinian politics, as it was the first time Hamas, primarily known for its armed resistance against Israel, gained political power. The elections were widely regarded as free and fair, monitored by international observers who commended the process despite the challenging political climate.

#### Factors Behind Hamas' Victory

Hamas' electoral success reflected widespread dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority (PA) under Fatah, which had been accused of corruption, inefficiency, and failing to deliver tangible improvements in governance or progress in peace negotiations. Hamas' campaign focused on anti-corruption promises, improving social services, and maintaining resistance against Israeli occupation. The group's network of schools, hospitals, and charities further bolstered its popularity among Palestinians.

#### International Reaction

The international community, including Israel, the United States, and the European Union, refused to recognize the Hamas-led government, labeling the organization as a terrorist group. These entities demanded that Hamas renounce violence, recognize Israel, and honor previous agreements. Hamas' refusal to comply led to the suspension of international aid to the Palestinian Authority and the imposition of sanctions, further exacerbating economic challenges in the territories.

### Formation of the Hamas-Led Government (March 2006)

#### Ismail Haniyeh as Prime Minister

In March 2006, Hamas formed a government, appointing Ismail Haniyeh as Prime Minister. Despite Hamas' electoral mandate, Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority and a Fatah leader, retained significant executive powers. This dual authority structure led to frequent clashes between the Hamas-led cabinet and Abbas over control of security forces, foreign relations, and governance.

#### Early Challenges

The Hamas-led government faced immediate and severe challenges. Israel froze the transfer of tax revenues collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, amounting to a significant portion of its budget. Coupled with international sanctions, this led to a fiscal crisis, leaving public sector employees unpaid for months and sparking widespread protests.

### Tensions Between Hamas and Fatah (Mid-2006)

#### Escalating Violence

Throughout 2006, tensions between Hamas and Fatah escalated into sporadic violence, particularly in Gaza. Armed groups affiliated with both factions clashed over control of security forces, government ministries, and public institutions. Kidnappings, assassinations, and targeted attacks on rival offices became commonplace.

#### Failed Mediation Efforts

Efforts by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar to mediate between Hamas and Fatah achieved temporary ceasefires, but these agreements were frequently violated. The lack of trust between the factions and their competing visions for Palestinian governance made lasting reconciliation elusive.

### Israeli-Palestinian Tensions: Kidnapping of Gilad Shalit (June 2006)

#### The Kidnapping Incident

On June 25, 2006, Hamas and allied militants launched a cross-border attack from Gaza, killing two Israeli soldiers and capturing a third, Gilad Shalit. The incident triggered a major escalation in violence between Israel and Hamas.

#### Israeli Retaliation: Operation Summer Rains

In response, Israel launched Operation Summer Rains, involving airstrikes on Gaza's infrastructure and ground incursions. The military campaign resulted in the deaths of over 400 Palestinians, including civilians, and caused significant destruction to Gaza's infrastructure. The operation heightened tensions and further isolated Gaza internationally.

### The Slide into Civil War (Late 2006-Early 2007)

#### Economic Collapse and Protests (January-February 2007)

By late 2006, international sanctions, Israel's blockade, and internal governance challenges had plunged the Palestinian territories into economic crisis. Public sector employees went unpaid for extended periods, leading to widespread protests and strikes. The dire economic conditions fueled animosity between Hamas and Fatah supporters.

#### Clashes Between Armed Factions - Street Battles in Gaza (March-May 2007)

Violent clashes intensified between Hamas' military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and Fatah-aligned security forces. Both factions accused each other of undermining the Palestinian cause and attempting to stage coups.

### Hamas' Takeover of Gaza (June 2007)

#### The Outbreak of Fighting

In June 2007, the power struggle between Hamas and Fatah erupted into full-scale fighting in Gaza. Hamas launched a coordinated offensive, targeting Fatah-controlled security installations and government buildings. The fighting resulted in dozens of casualties and widespread destruction.

#### Hamas Establishes Control Over Gaza and the Division of Palestinian Territories

After several days of intense battles, Hamas seized full control of Gaza, forcing Fatah officials to flee to the West Bank or seek refuge in Israel and Egypt. The takeover marked the effective division of the Palestinian territories into two separate political entities:

-   Gaza Strip: Governed by Hamas, which implemented its own administrative and security policies.
-   West Bank: Controlled by the Palestinian Authority, dominated by Fatah under Mahmoud Abbas.

### Consequences of the Political Division

#### Economic Isolation and Humanitarian Crisis

The Hamas takeover prompted Israel and Egypt to impose a stricter blockade on Gaza, citing security concerns. The blockade, combined with Hamas' inability to access international aid, led to severe economic and humanitarian crises. Unemployment soared (over 50%), and shortages of food, medicine, and building materials became chronic.

#### Polarization of Palestinian Politics

The division entrenched political polarization among Palestinians, with Hamas and Fatah each claiming legitimacy while accusing the other of betraying the Palestinian cause. This split weakened Palestinian efforts to negotiate with Israel and undermined prospects for a two-state solution.

#### International Reactions

The international community continued to recognize the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Efforts by regional powers, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to mediate between Hamas and Fatah repeatedly failed, leaving the Palestinian territories politically fragmented.
