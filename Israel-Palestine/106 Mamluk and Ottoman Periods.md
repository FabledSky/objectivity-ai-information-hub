## Mamluk and Ottoman Periods
This section explores the Mamluk and Ottoman Periods in the Israel-Palestine region, spanning from 1260 CE to 1917 CE, detailing political, social, and cultural developments under two major Islamic empires.

#### Mamluk Sultanate and Rule of the Levant (1260-1517 CE)

##### Mamluks Defeat the Mongols at Ain Jalut (1260 CE)

The Mamluks, a military caste that rose to power in Egypt, decisively defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. This battle, fought near modern-day Galilee, marked the first significant defeat of the Mongols and secured Mamluk control over the Levant, including Palestine. This victory ended the Mongol threat to the region and ensured its inclusion in the Mamluk Sultanate, based in Cairo. 

##### End of the Crusader Presence (1291 CE)

In 1291, the Mamluks captured Acre, the last Crusader stronghold in the Levant, effectively ending two centuries of Crusader presence in the region. Following this victory, the Mamluks dismantled remaining Crusader fortifications to prevent any future incursions. 

##### Economic and Administrative Reforms

The Mamluks established a system of provincial governance, dividing the Levant into smaller administrative units governed by emirs. Jerusalem, Gaza, and Nablus became key centers of trade and administration. Mamluk policies encouraged trade along the Silk Road and other routes, linking Palestine to markets in Egypt, Syria, and beyond. 

##### Urban Development and Religious Investment

The Mamluks heavily invested in Jerusalem, restoring and enhancing Islamic holy sites, including the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque. They also constructed new religious schools (madrasas), inns (khans), and public baths (hammams) to support pilgrimage and economic activity. These projects reinforced Jerusalem's status as a major Islamic spiritual and cultural center. 

##### Decline of the Mamluks

By the late 15th century, the Mamluks faced economic decline due to the discovery of maritime trade routes that bypassed the Levant, reducing their revenue from overland trade. Additionally, internal corruption and external pressures, particularly from the rising Ottoman Empire, weakened their grip on the region. 

#### Ottoman Rule in the Levant (1517-1917 CE)

##### Ottoman Conquest of the Region (1517 CE)

In 1517, the Ottoman Empire, under Sultan Selim I, defeated the Mamluks at the Battle of Ridanieh, annexing the Levant, including Palestine, into the empire. The region became part of the province of Greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), with Jerusalem designated as an important administrative and religious center. 

##### 16th Century: Integration and Early Development

The Ottomans implemented centralized governance and conducted land surveys to register property and standardize taxation. These reforms provided stability and integrated the region into the broader Ottoman economy. Major infrastructure projects, such as the restoration of aqueducts and roads, were undertaken to facilitate trade and pilgrimage. Jerusalem benefited from significant investment, including the restoration of the Haram al-Sharif complex. 

##### 17th-18th Centuries: Relative Stability and Local Autonomy

During this period, the region experienced relative stability but remained on the periphery of Ottoman priorities. Local elites, such as the al-Husayni family in Jerusalem, gained influence, often acting as intermediaries between the central Ottoman government and local populations. Agricultural production and trade, including olive oil and soap exports, sustained the regional economy. 

##### 19th Century: Tanzimat Reforms and Modernization

The Tanzimat reforms (1839-1876) aimed to modernize the Ottoman Empire and centralize its administration. In Palestine, these reforms introduced land registration laws, modern schools, and new infrastructure projects, including railways. The region saw increased European involvement, with Christian powers funding the restoration of holy sites and establishing missionary schools and hospitals. 

##### Egyptian Occupation Under Muhammad Ali (1831-1840 CE)

Between 1831 and 1840, the region was occupied by Egyptian forces under Muhammad Ali Pasha. The Egyptians sought to modernize agriculture and industry, though their policies met resistance from local populations. The Ottomans, with European support, eventually regained control. 

##### Late 19th Century: Rise of Nationalism and Zionist Settlement

Nationalist movements began emerging across the Ottoman Empire, including Arab nationalism in the Levant. Concurrently, waves of Jewish immigration, driven by the rise of Zionism and European antisemitism, brought new settlers to Palestine. Jewish immigrants purchased land and established agricultural communities, laying the foundation for future demographic and political shifts.

##### World War I and the End of Ottoman Rule (1914-1917 CE)

During World War I, the Ottoman Empire aligned with the Central Powers. The Levant became a key theater of conflict, with British forces capturing Jerusalem in December 1917. The war's end marked the collapse of Ottoman control, leading to the establishment of British rule under the League of Nations Mandate system.
