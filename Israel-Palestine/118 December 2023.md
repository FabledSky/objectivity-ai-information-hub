Israeli forces engaged in intense clashes with Hamas fighters in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, a key stronghold for Hamas operations.

-   Israeli Military Operations: The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) deployed ground troops supported by aerial surveillance and precision strikes to dismantle Hamas infrastructure in the area.
-   Civilian Impact: The clashes led to significant destruction in residential neighborhoods, displacing thousands of residents and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Reports indicated civilian casualties as both sides engaged in urban warfare.
-   Hamas Resistance: Hamas fighters employed guerrilla tactics, including ambushes and the use of underground tunnels, to counter Israeli advances. This prolonged the fighting and increased the intensity of the conflict.

-   Military Operations: Israeli forces employed advanced technology, including ground-penetrating radar and aerial surveillance, to locate and neutralize the tunnels.
