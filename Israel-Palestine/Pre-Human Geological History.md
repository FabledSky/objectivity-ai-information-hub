## Pre-Human Geological History

### Formation of the Region: 4.6 Billion Years Ago to the Precambrian Era

The region now encompassing Israel and Palestine began forming with the Earth's crust approximately 4.6 billion years ago. During the Precambrian era, vast tectonic activity shaped the area's ancient basement rocks, which remain buried beneath younger sedimentary layers. These rocks are part of the Arabian-Nubian Shield, a large tectonic formation spanning parts of Africa and the Middle East. Evidence suggests this period laid the foundation for the region's diverse topography.

### Shaping of the Levant: Paleozoic to Mesozoic Eras (541--66 Million Years Ago)

During the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, the region was covered by shallow seas, leading to the accumulation of limestone, sandstone, and other sedimentary rocks. These layers are rich in fossils, offering insight into the area's ancient marine life. By the Jurassic period (201--145 million years ago), tectonic activity began uplifting parts of the region, forming early landmasses.

### The Tethys Sea and Continental Drift: Cenozoic Era (66 Million Years Ago to Present)

The breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and the closure of the Tethys Sea during the Cenozoic era significantly influenced the region's geological structure. This period saw the Arabian plate separating from Africa and colliding with the Eurasian plate, giving rise to the Zagros Mountains and the rift valley systems. The Jordan Rift Valley, part of the Great Rift System, is a key feature resulting from this tectonic activity. 

### Formation of the Dead Sea Basin

The Dead Sea Basin, one of the most prominent geological features of the region, formed approximately 3--5 million years ago due to tectonic shifts along the Jordan Rift Valley. The basin is the lowest point on Earth's surface and contains hypersaline waters, making it a unique ecological and geological landmark. 

### Climatic Evolution

Throughout its geological history, the region has experienced significant climatic changes, transitioning from tropical conditions during the Mesozoic to arid desert landscapes in the Cenozoic. These changes have shaped the area's biodiversity and the availability of resources, influencing its habitability for early humans and later civilizations.
