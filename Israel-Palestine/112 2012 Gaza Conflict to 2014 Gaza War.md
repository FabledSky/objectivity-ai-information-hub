This section delves into the critical events from the 2012 Gaza Conflict (Operation Pillar of Defense) to the 2014 Gaza War (Operation Protective Edge), emphasizing political, military, and humanitarian developments.

### 2012 Gaza Conflict: Operation Pillar of Defense (November 14-21, 2012)

#### Trigger: Assassination of Ahmed Jabari

On November 14, 2012, Israel launched Operation Pillar of Defense by targeting Ahmed Jabari, a senior Hamas military commander, in an airstrike. Israel stated this was a preemptive measure in response to escalating rocket fire from Gaza. Jabari's assassination marked a significant escalation in hostilities.

#### Military Campaign and Rocket Fire

-   Israeli Airstrikes: Israel conducted over 1,500 airstrikes, targeting Hamas' rocket launch sites, weapons stockpiles, and government infrastructure. Key buildings, including the Ministry of Interior in Gaza, were destroyed.
-   Hamas' Response: Hamas and other militant groups fired over 1,500 rockets into Israel, targeting major cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the first time. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted hundreds of these rockets, preventing widespread casualties.

#### Casualties and Damage

-   Palestinian Death Toll: Over 170 Palestinians were killed, including militants and civilians, with significant destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.
-   Israeli Death Toll: Six Israelis, including both civilians and soldiers, were killed.
-   Humanitarian Impact: Gaza's civilian population faced severe hardships, with thousands displaced by the destruction.

#### Ceasefire Agreement

On November 21, 2012, Egypt brokered a ceasefire, ending the eight-day conflict. The agreement included commitments to halt rocket fire and relax border restrictions, but the blockade remained largely intact. The ceasefire highlighted Egypt's role as a key mediator in the conflict.

### 2013: Political Developments and Regional Changes

#### Sporadic Violence and Border Clashes

-   Rocket fire from Gaza and Israeli airstrikes persisted throughout 2013, albeit at lower levels compared to the previous conflict.
-   The fragile ceasefire was frequently breached, underscoring the enduring volatility in the region.

#### Collapse of U.S.-Brokered Peace Talks

-   Key Issues Discussed: Borders, the status of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, and Israeli settlements.
-   Outcome: The talks collapsed in April 2014 after nine months, with both sides blaming each other. Israeli settlement expansion and Palestinian reconciliation efforts were major points of contention.

#### Egypt's Changing Role

-   After the July 2013 coup in Egypt that ousted President Mohamed Morsi, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's government adopted a hardline stance toward Hamas, accusing it of supporting militants in the Sinai Peninsula.
-   Egypt intensified its crackdown on Gaza's smuggling tunnels, destroying hundreds of them, which further isolated Gaza and exacerbated its economic crisis.

### 2014: Rising Tensions Leading to the Gaza War

-   In April 2014, Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement to form a unity government, aiming to end the political division between Gaza and the West Bank.

#### Kidnapping and Murder of Israeli Teenagers (June 2014)

-   On June 12, 2014, three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in the West Bank.
-   Operation Brother's Keeper: Israel launched a large-scale military operation, arresting hundreds of Hamas members in the West Bank and conducting raids on Palestinian homes.
-   Hamas' Denial: While Israel accused Hamas of orchestrating the abductions, Hamas denied involvement, though the incident heightened tensions significantly.

#### Retaliatory Violence: Murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir (July 2014)

-   In July 2014, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, a 16-year-old Palestinian, was kidnapped and murdered by Jewish extremists in East Jerusalem, reportedly in retaliation for the killing of the Israeli teenagers.
-   The murder sparked widespread protests and clashes across Jerusalem and the West Bank, further escalating tensions.

### 2014 Gaza War: Operation Protective Edge (July 8-August 26, 2014)

#### Outbreak of War (July 8, 2014)
