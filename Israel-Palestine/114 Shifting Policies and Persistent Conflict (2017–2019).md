## Shifting Policies and Persistent Conflict (2017–2019)
This section delves deeply into the events of 2017--2019, a period of critical significance in the Israel-Palestine conflict. These years were marked by significant policy shifts, political upheavals, and recurring violence, with lasting implications for the region.

### 2017: Shifting U.S. Policies and Rising Regional Tensions

#### Donald Trump Assumes Office (January 2017)

Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th President of the United States marked a major departure in U.S. policy regarding Israel and Palestine.

-   Pro-Israel Orientation: Trump expressed unequivocal support for Israel, fostering a closer relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Unlike his predecessors, Trump openly questioned the viability of a two-state solution, signaling potential U.S. backing for alternative frameworks.
-   Embassy Relocation Promise: During his campaign, Trump pledged to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. While prior administrations had avoided this due to its sensitivity, Trump's administration viewed it as a reaffirmation of U.S. support for Israel. This announcement sparked significant concern among Palestinians, who viewed it as a deliberate dismissal of their claims to East Jerusalem.

#### Hamas' New Political Charter (May 2017)

In a strategic move, Hamas unveiled a revised political charter in May 2017, reflecting subtle shifts in its stance on key issues.

-   Acceptance of 1967 Borders: The charter indicated Hamas' willingness to accept a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, though it continued to reject Israel's legitimacy.
-   Distancing from Muslim Brotherhood: By distancing itself from the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas sought to improve its strained relations with Egypt and other regional powers.
-   Israel's Reaction: Israeli officials dismissed the new charter as a public relations stunt, pointing to Hamas' continued support for armed resistance and rocket attacks against Israel.

#### Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa Clashes (July 2017)

The summer of 2017 saw heightened tensions at the Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to both Muslims and Jews.

-   Metal Detectors Installed: After an attack that killed two Israeli police officers, Israel introduced new security measures, including metal detectors at the entrances to the compound.
-   Palestinian Response: Palestinians perceived the measures as an encroachment on their religious freedoms, sparking widespread protests and violent clashes across East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
-   Israeli Reversal: Amid mounting international pressure, Israel removed the metal detectors, but tensions over the site remained unresolved, with sporadic clashes continuing throughout the year.

#### U.S. Recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's Capital (December 2017)

In a landmark decision, Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced plans to relocate the U.S. embassy there.

-   International Backlash: The announcement was met with widespread condemnation, with the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly passing a resolution denouncing the decision. Protests erupted across the Arab world, and Palestinian leaders accused the U.S. of abandoning its role as an impartial mediator.
-   Implications: This move effectively sidelined the U.S. in peace negotiations and emboldened Israeli settlement activity in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.

### 2018: Escalating Violence and Controversial Legislation

#### The Great March of Return (March--December 2018)

In March 2018, Palestinians in Gaza launched the Great March of Return, a series of weekly protests along the border with Israel.

-   Demands: Protesters called for the right of return for Palestinian refugees and an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza.
-   Israeli Response:
    -   Israeli forces deployed snipers, tear gas, and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, arguing that Hamas was using the protests as a cover for attacks on the border.
    -   Critics accused Israel of using excessive force, with human rights organizations condemning the high civilian death toll.
-   Casualties:
    -   Over 200 Palestinians were killed during the protests, including children, journalists, and medics. Thousands were injured, many with life-altering disabilities.
    -   One Israeli soldier was killed during the protests.

#### U.S. Embassy Relocation to Jerusalem (May 2018)

On May 14, 2018, the U.S. officially relocated its embassy to Jerusalem, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of Israel's founding.

-   Palestinian Protests: The event triggered mass demonstrations along the Gaza border, culminating in one of the deadliest days of the Great March of Return. Over 60 Palestinians were killed, and hundreds were injured by Israeli live fire.
-   Diplomatic Repercussions: The relocation further alienated the U.S. from international consensus on Jerusalem's status and deepened Palestinian distrust of American mediation.

#### Passage of the Nation-State Law (July 2018)

The Israeli Knesset passed the Nation-State Law, formally defining Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.

-   Key Provisions:
    -   Hebrew was established as the sole official language, with Arabic given "special status."
    -   The law emphasized that national self-determination was unique to Jewish citizens.
-   Reactions:
    -   Palestinians: The law was denounced as discriminatory, with critics arguing that it marginalized Israel's Arab minority and undermined the principle of equality.
    -   Israeli Supporters: Proponents defended the law as a reaffirmation of Israel's Jewish identity and historical legacy.

### 2019: Continued Violence, Political Deadlock, and ICC Investigations

#### Rocket Attacks and Retaliatory Strikes

Sporadic rocket fire from Gaza and Israeli airstrikes continued throughout 2019, underscoring the fragility of ceasefire agreements.

-   Escalation in March: A long-range rocket from Gaza struck a home in central Israel, injuring civilians. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad facilities.
-   Cycle of Violence: These incidents often triggered brief escalations, with both sides exchanging fire before returning to uneasy truces brokered by Egypt and the United Nations.

#### Israeli Elections and Political Deadlock

Israel held two parliamentary elections in 2019 due to political stalemates:

-   April Election: Netanyahu's Likud party narrowly won but failed to form a coalition, leading to another election in September.
-   September Election: The second election also produced no clear majority, leaving Israeli politics in a state of paralysis.
-   Impact: The deadlock delayed major policy decisions and underscored divisions within Israeli society over issues like settlement expansion, religious influence, and Netanyahu's leadership.

#### U.S. Recognition of Israeli Sovereignty Over the Golan Heights (March 2019)

Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategic territory captured from Syria in 1967.

-   International Reaction: The move was widely condemned, with most countries maintaining that the Golan Heights remains Syrian territory under international law. Critics argued that the decision set a dangerous precedent for territorial disputes worldwide.

#### ICC Investigation Announcement (December 2019)

The International Criminal Court (ICC) announced its intent to investigate alleged war crimes in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.

-   Palestinian Reaction: Palestinian leaders welcomed the investigation as a step toward accountability.
-   Israeli Response: Israel rejected the investigation, arguing that the ICC lacked jurisdiction and accusing it of political bias.
