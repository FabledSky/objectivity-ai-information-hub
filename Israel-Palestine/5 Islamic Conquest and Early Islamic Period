## Islamic Conquest and Early Islamic Period
#### Rise of Islam in Arabia (622 CE)

Islam emerged in the early 7th century in the Arabian Peninsula under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad. The migration (Hijra) of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE marked the foundation of the first Muslim polity and the start of the Islamic calendar. Over the next decade, Muhammad unified much of Arabia through diplomacy, religious preaching, and military campaigns, establishing Islam as both a faith and a political framework. By the time of his death in 632 CE, the Arabian Peninsula was largely consolidated under Islamic rule. 

#### The Rashidun Caliphate and Early Conquests (632--661 CE)

Following Muhammad's death, the Rashidun Caliphate expanded Islam beyond Arabia. The second caliph, Umar ibn al-Khattab, led the Muslim armies to victory against the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Yarmouk in 636 CE, a decisive conflict that secured Muslim control over the Levant, including Palestine. The region transitioned from Byzantine to Islamic governance, and non-Muslims, including Christians and Jews, were recognized as protected communities under the dhimmi system, which granted them religious freedom in exchange for a tax. This arrangement facilitated a relatively peaceful integration of the region into the Islamic world. 

#### Jerusalem's Integration into the Islamic World (638 CE)

In 638 CE, Caliph Umar entered Jerusalem following its peaceful surrender by the city's Christian leadership. According to historical accounts, Umar respected the city's Christian sanctuaries, choosing not to pray inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to avoid its appropriation as a mosque. Instead, he selected a site near the ruins of the Second Temple for Muslim prayer, which later became the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This marked the beginning of Jerusalem's status as the third holiest city in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. Umar's administration ensured religious coexistence and protection for the city's Christian and Jewish communities. 

#### Umayyad Dynasty and Jerusalem's Expansion (661--750 CE)

Under the Umayyad Caliphate, Jerusalem underwent significant development. In 691 CE, Caliph Abd al-Malik commissioned the construction of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif). This architectural achievement symbolized the prominence of Islam and the Umayyads' religious and political authority. The Dome of the Rock also became a focal point of Islamic devotion, commemorating the Prophet Muhammad's night journey (Isra and Mi'raj). During this period, Jerusalem remained a hub for pilgrimage and Islamic scholarship, with the Al-Aqsa Mosque also receiving enhancements.

#### Abbasid Rule and Decline of Jerusalem's Prominence (750--969 CE)

The Abbasid Caliphate, which succeeded the Umayyads, shifted the political center of the Islamic world to Baghdad, reducing Jerusalem's administrative importance. However, the city retained its religious significance as a center for Muslim pilgrimage and scholarship. The Abbasid rulers contributed to the preservation of Jerusalem's Islamic heritage but focused their resources on other regions of their vast empire. This period saw a relative decline in large-scale development projects in the city. 

#### Fatimid Caliphate and Instability in Jerusalem (969--1099 CE)

The Fatimids, a Shia Muslim dynasty based in Cairo, gained control of Jerusalem in 969 CE. While the city remained an important religious site, it experienced periodic instability due to internal Fatimid struggles and external pressures. In 1009 CE, Caliph al-Hakim ordered the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a decision that caused outrage in Christian Europe and contributed to the tensions leading to the Crusades. Subsequent Fatimid rulers attempted to repair relations with Christian communities by rebuilding the church and restoring religious freedoms. 

#### Seljuk Turks and the Prelude to the Crusades (11th Century CE)

By the late 11th century, Jerusalem fell under the control of the Seljuk Turks, who imposed restrictions on Christian pilgrimages and reportedly mistreated pilgrims. These actions, combined with the strategic importance of the region, alarmed Christian Europe and led to the call for the First Crusade in 1095 CE. The Seljuk period marked a time of increased militarization and political fragmentation in the region, weakening its defenses against external invasions.
