## 2009–2012: Events Between the Goldstone Report and Operation Pillar of Defense
This section explores the major events between the release of the Goldstone Report in 2009 and the beginning of the 2012 Gaza conflict (Operation Pillar of Defense), highlighting significant developments in the Israel-Palestine conflict during this period.

#### Aftermath of the Goldstone Report (2009)

##### Release and Impact of the Report

In September 2009, the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission, led by Justice Richard Goldstone, published its findings on the 2008-2009 Gaza War. The report accused both Israel and Hamas of committing potential war crimes, with Israel criticized for disproportionate use of force and Hamas for indiscriminately targeting Israeli civilians.

-   Israel's Reaction: Israel dismissed the report as biased and emphasized its right to defend its citizens against rocket fire. It conducted internal investigations but argued that the report ignored the complexities of asymmetric warfare.
-   Hamas' Reaction: Hamas welcomed the report's condemnation of Israel but denied allegations that it used human shields or violated international law.

##### Broader International Reactions

The Goldstone Report intensified global debates about the legality and morality of actions during the Gaza War. While it increased scrutiny of Israel's policies in Gaza, it also highlighted the challenges of addressing violations in protracted conflicts.

#### The Gaza Freedom Flotilla Incident (May 2010)

##### The Flotilla and Israeli Raid

In May 2010, the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, a convoy of six ships led by the Turkish vessel Mavi Marmara, attempted to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Israeli naval forces intercepted the flotilla in international waters, boarding the vessels. A violent confrontation ensued aboard the Mavi Marmara, resulting in the deaths of nine Turkish activists and injuries to dozens of others.

-   Israeli Perspective: Israel argued that the flotilla aimed to provoke a confrontation and that its forces acted in self-defense after being attacked with knives and metal rods.
-   International Outcry: The incident sparked widespread condemnation, with critics arguing that Israel used excessive force. The United Nations launched an inquiry, which criticized Israel's actions but also affirmed the legality of the blockade under international law.

##### Diplomatic Fallout

-   Relations between Israel and Turkey, once strong, deteriorated significantly. Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador, downgraded diplomatic ties, and demanded an official apology and compensation for the victims.
-   The incident galvanized international calls to end the blockade, although Israel maintained its security rationale.

#### Easing of the Gaza Blockade (June 2010)

##### Policy Shift by Israel

In response to international pressure following the flotilla incident, Israel announced measures to ease the blockade. It allowed more consumer goods into Gaza while maintaining restrictions on items deemed dual-use, such as construction materials and fuel, which Israel argued could be used for military purposes.

-   Impact on Gaza's Economy: The easing had limited effects, as key industries reliant on exports and construction materials remained crippled. Gaza's unemployment and poverty rates remained among the highest in the world.

##### Humanitarian Criticism

While the easing allowed for an increase in humanitarian aid, rights groups argued that the blockade continued to constitute collective punishment under international law. The restrictions perpetuated Gaza's dependence on international aid, limiting its economic recovery.

#### Palestinian Bid for UN Membership (2011)

##### Application for Full UN Membership

In September 2011, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas submitted an application for Palestine to become a full member state of the United Nations. Abbas argued that international recognition of Palestinian statehood was essential for achieving peace.

-   UN Security Council Response: The bid faced strong opposition from the United States, which threatened to veto the proposal, and failed to secure the necessary support within the Security Council.

##### Symbolic Importance

Despite the setback, the move highlighted growing international sympathy for the Palestinian cause and frustration with the stalled peace process. The bid reinforced Palestinian efforts to gain recognition through multilateral institutions.

#### Arab Spring and Regional Shifts (2011)

##### Impact of the Arab Spring

The wave of uprisings across the Arab world significantly reshaped regional dynamics:

-   Egypt: The ousting of President Hosni Mubarak, a key mediator in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, created uncertainty about Egypt's future role. While Egypt's military maintained the peace treaty with Israel, popular sentiment became increasingly critical of Israel.
-   Syria: Hamas' ties with Syria were strained as the Syrian Civil War erupted. Hamas distanced itself from the Assad regime, aligning more closely with Qatar and Turkey.

##### Hamas' Changing Alliances

Hamas' realignment weakened its traditional support base in Syria and Iran but strengthened its ties with Sunni powers such as Turkey and Qatar. These shifting alliances influenced the group's strategies and regional relationships.

#### Renewed Violence and Tensions (2012)

##### Rocket Fire and Israeli Airstrikes

Throughout 2012, violence along the Gaza-Israel border escalated. Militant groups in Gaza fired rockets into Israeli cities, prompting Israeli airstrikes targeting Hamas and other factions.

-   Iron Dome Deployment: Israel deployed its Iron Dome missile defense system to intercept rockets, significantly reducing casualties and damage in southern cities.

##### Hunger Strikes by Palestinian Prisoners

Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails launched hunger strikes to protest administrative detention (imprisonment without trial) and poor prison conditions.

-   International Attention: The hunger strikes drew significant international attention and placed pressure on Israel to address prisoner rights, highlighting the broader issue of human rights in the occupied territories.

##### Settlement Expansion

Israel continued to expand settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, despite international condemnation. These actions further complicated efforts to restart peace negotiations and fueled Palestinian grievances about the erosion of their territorial claims.
