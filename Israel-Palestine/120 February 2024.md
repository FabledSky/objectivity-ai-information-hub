-   Food Shortages and Blockade Impact:
    -   The continued Israeli blockade severely restricted the flow of goods, including essential food supplies, into Gaza.
    -   Local food production was decimated due to the destruction of farmland and infrastructure during the conflict.
-   WFP Operations: The WFP reported significant challenges in delivering aid due to logistical barriers, security risks, and limited access through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.
-   Humanitarian Implications:
    -   Malnutrition rates increased, particularly among children, as food rations became insufficient to meet the population's needs.
    -   International humanitarian agencies warned of long-term health consequences for the population, particularly for vulnerable groups.
