This section provides an in-depth account of the events from 2020 to October 6, 2023, highlighting key developments in the Israel-Palestine conflict. It explores significant political, military, and humanitarian events.

### 2020: The Abraham Accords and Pandemic Impact

#### COVID-19 Pandemic and Humanitarian Challenges

The global COVID-19 pandemic severely affected the Israel-Palestine region, particularly Gaza, where pre-existing challenges amplified the crisis.

-   Healthcare in Gaza and the West Bank:
    -   Gaza's healthcare system, already strained due to the blockade, faced shortages of essential supplies and equipment.
    -   In the West Bank, Palestinian authorities imposed lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus, further damaging the fragile economy.
-   Limited Cooperation: While Israeli and Palestinian health authorities coordinated on vaccine distribution and medical supplies, political tensions limited broader cooperation.
-   Economic Impact: The blockade in Gaza and pandemic-related restrictions led to widespread unemployment and food insecurity, with over 80% of Gaza's population relying on international aid.

##### The Abraham Accords (August-December 2020)

The Abraham Accords, brokered by the United States, marked a historic normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab nations, including the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan.

-   Regional Realignment:
    -   These agreements reflected a shift in regional priorities, emphasizing economic cooperation and countering Iranian influence over longstanding support for the Palestinian cause.
    -   Palestinians criticized the accords as a betrayal, arguing they undermined the Arab Peace Initiative, which tied normalization to the creation of a Palestinian state.
-   Economic Opportunities: The accords facilitated trade, investment, and tourism between Israel and its new partners, reshaping regional geopolitics.

#### Halted Annexation Plans in the West Bank

In exchange for normalization with the UAE, Israel agreed to suspend plans to annex large parts of the West Bank.

-   International Response: While the suspension was welcomed internationally, Palestinians viewed it as a temporary concession rather than a meaningful step toward peace.
-   Settlement Activity: Despite the halted annexation, Israel continued to expand settlements in the West Bank, drawing international condemnation.

### 2021: Sheikh Jarrah Evictions and Gaza Conflict

#### Sheikh Jarrah Evictions and East Jerusalem Clashes (May 2021)

The planned evictions of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem, triggered widespread protests and international attention.

-   Legal and Historical Context:
    -   The evictions stemmed from a long-standing legal battle over property claims by Jewish organizations based on pre-1948 ownership.
    -   Palestinians argued that the evictions were part of a broader effort to Judaize East Jerusalem and displace its Arab population.
-   Al-Aqsa Mosque Clashes: Protests escalated into violent confrontations at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound during Ramadan. Israeli police used stun grenades and rubber bullets, injuring hundreds of worshippers, while Palestinians threw stones at security forces.

#### 2021 Gaza Conflict (May 10-21, 2021)

The violence in East Jerusalem sparked a military confrontation between Hamas and Israel, marking one of the most intense conflicts since 2014.

-   Hamas Rocket Fire: Hamas launched thousands of rockets toward Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, Be'er Sheva, and Ashdod, in response to the Al-Aqsa clashes and Sheikh Jarrah evictions.
-   Israeli Airstrikes: Israel targeted Hamas infrastructure, including tunnels, rocket launch sites, and high-rise buildings, leading to significant destruction in Gaza.
-   Casualties and Damage:
    -   Over 250 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children, while 13 Israelis, including children, also lost their lives.
    -   The conflict displaced over 77,000 Palestinians and caused extensive damage to Gaza's infrastructure.
-   Ceasefire: Egypt brokered a ceasefire after 11 days of intense fighting, though the underlying issues remained unresolved.

#### Israeli Government Changes (June 2021)

After 12 years in power, Benjamin Netanyahu was replaced by a coalition government led by Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid.

-   Coalition Composition: The government included ideologically diverse parties, including an Arab-Israeli party, a first in Israeli history.
-   Challenges: Internal divisions and external pressures, particularly regarding settlement expansion and security policies, strained the coalition's stability.

### 2022: Heightened Tensions and Political Realignments

#### Violence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem

The West Bank witnessed a significant rise in violence, with frequent confrontations between Israeli forces, settlers, and Palestinians.

-   Israeli Raids: Military operations in Palestinian towns and refugee camps intensified, often targeting suspected militants. These raids frequently resulted in civilian casualties.
-   Settlement Expansion: Continued settlement growth exacerbated tensions, with international actors calling for an immediate halt.

#### Killing of Journalist Shireen Abu Akleh (May 2022)

Veteran Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed during an Israeli military operation in Jenin.

-   Controversy:
    -   Palestinian authorities and international media accused Israeli forces of targeting Abu Akleh.
    -   Israel claimed she may have been caught in crossfire but later investigations suggested that an Israeli soldier was likely responsible.
-   Global Reaction: The killing drew widespread condemnation, with calls for accountability from human rights organizations and foreign governments.

#### Israeli Elections (November 2022)

Netanyahu returned to power after the fifth election in four years, forming a coalition government with far-right and ultra-Orthodox parties.

-   Policy Changes: The new government pursued judicial reforms, expanded settlement activity, and increased security operations in Palestinian areas.
-   Palestinian Concerns: Palestinians expressed alarm over the inclusion of far-right figures in the coalition, fearing harsher policies in the West Bank and Gaza.

### 2023: Rising Violence and Internal Unrest

#### Judicial Reforms and Protests in Israel

Netanyahu's government proposed sweeping judicial reforms, sparking mass protests across Israel.

-   Public Backlash: Protesters argued the reforms threatened Israeli democracy by weakening the judiciary's independence.
-   Impact on the Conflict: The domestic unrest diverted attention from the Israel-Palestine conflict but also raised questions about the government's stability.

#### Violence in the West Bank and Gaza

-   West Bank Clashes: Armed raids, settler violence, and Palestinian attacks escalated significantly in 2023, leading to dozens of casualties on both sides.
-   Rocket Fire from Gaza: Sporadic rocket attacks from Gaza prompted Israeli airstrikes, with both sides accusing the other of violating ceasefire agreements.

#### Al-Aqsa Mosque Clashes (April 2023)

During Ramadan, Israeli police raided the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, citing security threats.

-   Protests: The raids sparked widespread protests and clashes in East Jerusalem, reminiscent of the 2021 violence.
-   International Reaction: The United Nations and several countries called for restraint, warning against further escalation.

#### Settlement Expansion and Evictions

-   Israeli authorities approved new settlement projects and carried out evictions in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, drawing condemnation from Palestinians and the international community.
