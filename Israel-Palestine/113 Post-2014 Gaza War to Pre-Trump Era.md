## Post-2014 Gaza War to Pre-Trump Era (2017)
This section provides an in-depth exploration of significant events between the conclusion of the 2014 Gaza War and the beginning of Donald Trump's presidency in January 2017, emphasizing key political, military, and humanitarian developments during this period.

### 2014: Aftermath of Operation Protective Edge

#### Reconstruction Challenges in Gaza

The 2014 Gaza War left over 20,000 homes destroyed or severely damaged, with Gaza's infrastructure in ruins. The Israeli blockade and political disputes between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority delayed reconstruction efforts.

-   Donor Conference (October 2014): An international donor conference held in Cairo pledged $5.4 billion for reconstruction. However, only a fraction of the funds were disbursed due to concerns over Hamas' governance and the lack of coordination between Palestinian factions.
-   Living Conditions: Electricity shortages, inadequate access to clean water, and widespread unemployment created a deepening humanitarian crisis, with over 80% of Gaza's population relying on international aid.

#### Escalation of Tensions in Jerusalem

In late 2014, clashes erupted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque/Temple Mount compound over perceived attempts by Israeli authorities to alter the status quo at the site.

-   Palestinian Protests: Palestinians accused Israel of restricting Muslim worshippers and allowing increased access to Jewish visitors.
-   Israeli Response: Israeli authorities cited security concerns, implementing measures that Palestinians viewed as provocative.\
    The violence extended to other parts of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, heightening tensions between communities.

### 2015: ICC Membership and Rise of Violence

#### Palestine Joins the International Criminal Court (ICC)

In April 2015, Palestine formally joined the ICC, enabling it to file cases against Israel for alleged war crimes committed during the 2014 Gaza War.

-   ICC Preliminary Investigations: The ICC began examining alleged violations of international law in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.
-   Israeli Reaction: Israel criticized the move as a unilateral action that undermined peace efforts. Israeli officials argued that the ICC was biased and overstepping its mandate.

##### Stabbing Intifada (Late 2015)

A surge of violence erupted in late 2015, characterized by a series of lone-wolf attacks by Palestinians against Israeli civilians and security personnel.

-   Nature of Attacks: The violence, often referred to as the "Stabbing Intifada," included stabbings, shootings, and vehicular rammings.
-   Casualties: Over 250 Palestinians and 30 Israelis were killed between late 2015 and 2016.
-   Israeli Response: Israeli forces increased security measures, including the deployment of troops and the use of live fire during clashes. Critics accused Israel of excessive force, while Israel argued its actions were necessary for self-defense.

### 2016: International Diplomacy and Settlements

#### Paris Peace Initiative

In June 2016, France convened an international conference to revive peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.

-   Objectives: The initiative aimed to establish a framework for a two-state solution, focusing on resolving core issues such as borders, settlements, and the status of Jerusalem.
-   Outcome: Israel rejected the initiative, arguing that direct negotiations were the only viable path to peace. Palestinian leaders supported the effort but expressed skepticism about its potential impact.

##### UN Security Council Resolution 2334

In December 2016, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2334, declaring Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem a violation of international law.

-   U.S. Abstention: The resolution passed after the U.S. abstained rather than using its veto power, a significant departure from previous U.S. policy.
-   Reactions:
    -   Israel: Strongly condemned the resolution, accusing the UN of bias and asserting its right to build in "disputed territories."
    -   Palestinians: Welcomed the resolution as a reaffirmation of international opposition to settlement expansion.

### Humanitarian Challenges in Gaza

#### Electricity Crisis (2015-2016)

Gaza experienced severe electricity shortages, with residents receiving only 4-6 hours of power per day.

-   Causes: The crisis stemmed from disputes between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority over payments for fuel, coupled with damage to Gaza's power infrastructure during the 2014 war.
-   Humanitarian Impact: Hospitals, water treatment facilities, and sanitation systems were severely affected, exacerbating public health challenges.

#### Egypt's Role in Gaza

Egypt, under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, maintained a strict policy toward Hamas, accusing the group of supporting militants in the Sinai Peninsula.

-   Rafah Crossing: Egypt frequently closed the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's primary gateway to the outside world.
-   Smuggling Tunnels: Egyptian forces destroyed hundreds of smuggling tunnels along the Gaza-Sinai border, cutting off a vital supply route for goods and weapons.

### Regional Implications and Political Shifts

#### Impact of the Syrian Civil War

The Syrian Civil War altered regional alliances, affecting Hamas' relationships with key actors:

-   Distance from Assad: Hamas distanced itself from the Assad regime in Syria, weakening its ties with Iran.
-   New Allies: Qatar and Turkey emerged as key supporters of Hamas, providing financial and political backing.

#### Palestinian Political Divisions

The divide between Hamas in Gaza and the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank deepened during this period:

-   Efforts to form a unity government repeatedly failed due to mutual distrust and conflicting priorities.
-   The division continued to undermine Palestinian political unity, complicating international diplomatic efforts.
